# Google-Authenticator-Common-Numbers

I'm conducting this research to evaluate the effectiveness of Google Auth's security measures. If vulnerabilities can be identified by a young individual, it raises concerns about the potential for more sophisticated actors to exploit these flaws. The development of automated scripts, such as those written in Python, could facilitate bypass or brute-force attacks utilizing this or other 2FA dataset's.

There are a total of 15 double or triple numbers in the given list of 100 numbers meaning 15% of geting a double or tripple number you can also see that double/tripple numbers are common by just looking at google auth app every like 1min

Common Numbers that show up are:
The most common number in the data set is 0. It appears 26 times.
The 2nd most common number in the data set is 3. It appears 20 times.
The 3rd most common number in the data set is 5. It appears 19 times.
The 4th most common number in the data set is 9. It appears 18 times.
The 5th most common number in the data set is 7. It appears 16 times.
The 6th most common number in the data set is 6. It appears 15 times.
The 7th most common number in the data set is 8. It appears 14 times.
The 8th most common number in the data set is 4. It appears 13 times.
The 9th most common number in the data set is 2. It appears 12 times.
The 10th most common number in the data set is 1. It appears 11 times.
The 11th most common number in the data set is 33. It appears 10 times.
The 12th most common number in the data set is 55. It appears 10 times.
